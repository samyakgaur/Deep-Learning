# Deep Learning From Scratch

ðŸŒŸ Learning Deep Learning concepts using python, numpy ðŸŒŸ

> Uses Python 3.7.4

#### This repository has detailed math equations and graphs for every feature implemented that can be used to serve as basis for greater, in-depth understanding of Neural Networks. Basic understanding of Linear Algebra, Matrix Operations and Calculus is assumed.

## Contents ðŸ“‘

## Setup ðŸ’»

```bash
git clone <url>
```


## Usage ðŸ“”

- Open the .pynb files in jupyter notebook


## Roadmap ðŸ“‘

- [x] Machine Learning
  - [x] Linear
  - [x] Logistic
- [x] Vectorization
  - [x] vectorization.pynb
  
##### This project is not meant to be production ready but instead serve as the foundation repository to understand the in-depth working of Deep Learning down to the mathematics of the task.

###### Collaborations in implementing and maintaining this project are welcome. Kindly reach out to me if interested.
